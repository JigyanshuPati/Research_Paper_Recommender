## Features

- **Semantic Search:** Find relevant arXiv papers using natural language queries.
- **Paper Preview:** Instantly view the first page of the top-matching paper.
- **Similarity Visualization:** See a bar plot of the top-k papers most similar to your query.
- **Question Answering:** Ask questions about the top paper and get answers powered by Google Gemini (via LangChain).
- **arXiv Integration:** Direct links to arXiv abstracts for further reading.
