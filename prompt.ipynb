The standard approach that has so far been \\nemployed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original \\nand compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard \\nformat. \\n \\nThe new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings \\ngenerated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision \\nmaking.  We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard \\ntreatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames).  To \\nillustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our \\ntheoretical assumptions is attached.  The routine is part of the Axon chess program, \\ndeveloped by the authors.  Axon, in its current incarnation, plays chess at master \\nstrength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo, based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs \\nhuman masters in over 3000 games altogether). \\n \\n \\n1. INTRODUCTION \\n \\n \\nThe solution to the problem of move repetition detection is very important for the \\ncreation of a computer chess playing program that follows and implements all official \\nrules of chess in its searcher [1],[2].  Namely, in accordance with the official rules of \\nchess there are two major types of positions in which a draw is proclaimed:  (a)  when \\nthe position in which the same side to move has been repeated three times in the \\ncourse of a game and (b) when no capture has been made or no pawns have been \\nmoved during the last fifty consecutive moves.   Having in mind that condition (b) can \\nbe implemented comparatively easily by using the data from the move generator, we \\nwill focus more closely on condition (a).   \\n \\nThe essence of the draw detection rule strives to prevent “endless” games  and to offer \\na possibility for a game to progress by means of non-reversible moves such as pawn \\nmovement or piece exchange and captures.  Naturally, in a game of average length a \\n                                                 \\n1 Main author and developer of the Axon chess engine; Faculty of Electrical Engineering, University of \\nNis, Serbia & Montenegro.

E-mail:   djordjev@medianis.net \\n \\n2 \\nrelatively high percentage of moves is due to maneuverability of piece moves which \\nlead to progress in games through a genuine transformation. \\n \\nBearing in mind the nature of the game of chess it is not merely sufficient to \\ninvestigate only positions stemming in the course of the tree search generation \\n(decision making) [6], but also to consider the game set-up prior to the actual position \\n- the so-called “game history”. \\n \\nThus we intend to offer a theoretical and practical solution to the issues we \\nmentioned.  There will be several sections dealing with various aspects of draw \\ndetection.  After this initial exposition, our next section will describe the classical \\napproach to draw detection based on the comparison of matrices.  The third section \\nwill present a new treatment that employs variant strings.  In the fourth section we \\nplan to lay out a blueprint for a solving algorithm. The fifth part of the article will \\ninclude a description of a routine written in assembly code implementing the \\ndiscussed algorithm, while the concluding section will deal with some experimental \\ndata relevant to the algorithm as implemented in the Axon chess program.  We will \\ncompare the behaviour of the program with and without the implemented procedure \\nfor draw detection. \\n \\n \\n \\n2. STANDARD APPROACH TO THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM \\n \\n \\nIn the process of recognition of draw detection and recurrently identical positions \\nchess programs employ the same memory structure used as an input for the move \\ngenerator.  This procedure aims at generating all legal moves stemming from the \\ncurrent position in any part of the search tree.  Regardless of the type of piece coding \\nwhich can vary a lot its common property is the existence of a positional matrix that \\nmemorizes the current position found in a part of the search tree.  Besides such \\nuncompressed forms of position representation there are various models using \\ncompression as well as models which represent positions in readable format, e.g. epd \\nand FEN representations.  Even though they require a lesser amount of memory these \\nformats are practically unusable, especially in endgame positions where one finds \\nmany empty squares. \\n \\nWhat happens here is that the time needed for compression and/or decompression \\ninto/out of such formats is significantly longer than the time spent in mere \\ncomparison, which leads us to think that they are not an efficient solution, particularly \\nwith regard to the speed of execution of the procedures being processed.   On the \\nother hand, we need to solve the problem of the internal representation of the chess \\nboard and piece coding in an efficient way too. The representational organization of \\nthe chess board [1],[3] depending on the move generation procedure, can be done in \\ndifferent ways, for example as an 8X8, 10X10, 12X10 or 12X12 byte grid.  Our \\nprogram, Axon, has a 12X12 byte matrix structure [7]. We should mention though that \\nit is only to be expected that performance-wise the best results are obtained with an \\n8X8 grid that is very much like an iconic representation of the chess board.  \\n \\n \\n3 \\nImplementations of other representational matrices lead to proportional slowdown, \\nbut the gains earned by the use of larger grids as compared to the 8X8 grid are faster \\nrecognition of the grid borders, one dimensional coding in place of two dimensional \\none, etc. \\n \\nIn order to explain the core problem better, let us propose a simple type of coding \\n(8X8 bytes). (Let us emphasize first that the manner of piece coding is completely \\nirrelevant to our further analysis and serves only as an illustration.) The chess board \\nhosts 12 different pieces (six white and six black pieces), therefore to represent all of \\nthem we need four bit coding.  The coding can be done in the following way: \\n \\n \\nTable 1.  Piece coding. \\n \\nPIECE \\nCODE \\nDec. \\nEmpty square oooo \\no \\nWhite pawn \\nooo1 \\n1 \\nWhite knight \\noo1o \\n2 \\nWhite bishop \\noo11 \\n3 \\nWhite rook \\no1oo \\n4 \\nWhite queen \\no1o1 \\n5 \\nWhite king \\no11o \\n6 \\nBlack pawn \\n1oo1 \\n9 \\nBlack knight \\n1o1o \\n1o \\nBlack bishop \\n1o11 \\n11 \\nBlack rook \\n11oo \\n12 \\nBlack queen \\n11o1 \\n13 \\nBlack king \\n111o \\n14 \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 1.  White draws by perpetual check. \\n \\nFigure 1 can serve as an example of a simple position in which White draws by a \\nperpetual check (1. Qh6+).  If we use the coding presented in Table 1 the internal \\nrepresentation of the 8X8 matrix would look like this: \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n4 \\n \\n \\n \\n13 \\no \\no \\no \\no \\n12 \\no \\n14 \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\n9 \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\no \\n5 \\no \\no \\no \\n6 \\no \\n \\n \\nFigure 2:  Coded form of a position  (Figure 1). \\n \\n \\nThe positional matrix in its uncompressed format shown in Figure 2 can be used \\ndirectly as input to an efficient move generator. This matrix is simultaneously part of \\nthe position detection procedure.  The capacity of the matrix is 64X8-bit, equaling 512 \\nbits, and that position comparison has to be done in the same format making the \\nprocedure inefficient.  The downside to this approach can be seen rather clearly in the \\nendgame where great portions of the chessboard are empty squares and a great deal of \\nmust be spent on comparisons of relatively similar positions.  Another disadvantage is \\nthat in long lasting games, with many moves played in the endgame, one has to take \\ninto account the length of the “game history”  so that the analysis may be extended to \\ntens of other, already played, positions.  We will list some of the methods that can \\nhelp to speed up or eliminate the inflated 512-bit comparison: \\n \\n \\n- \\nIn the search stage we start with a position that is currently being evaluated as the \\ndeepest in the search tree. The investigation extends towards the root of the search \\ntree. If there is some sort of “relevant history” the search must be extended onto \\npositions stored in the corresponding data structures. If a repeated position is \\nfound (such cases are rare from a statistical point of view) the moves that might \\notherwise be produced by this node are not generated and the evaluation is not \\nassigned.  The value of 0.00 is automatically put down as the evaluation mark \\ninstead. Since the comparison is done only in the case when the same side is to \\nmove it is necessary to take into account only positions with either even or odd \\ndepths depending on whether the current position that serves as a start point is of \\neven or odd ply depth. This helps to reduce the number of possible search queries \\nby 50%.  \\n \\n- \\nThe search has to be terminated at the moment a position that resulted from an \\nexchange of pieces or pawn advancement has been registered. If no position \\nrepetition had been registered up to that moment, a conclusion has to be drawn \\nthat there was no position repetition whatsoever. \\n \\n  \\n- \\nIn order to speed up the search a positional checksum (16-bit) can be introduced \\nso that the control checksum should be verified before any comparison of \\n \\n5 \\npositions.  In case the sums do not check out correctly there is no need to \\ninvestigate complete matrices:  they simply have to differ.  As checksum a part of \\nthe hash key variable can be used, of course if the program has viable hash \\nsupport. \\n  \\n- \\nUsing the 32-bit architecture of modern processors 32-bit registers can also be \\nexploited for comparison purposes.  In this manner, we could ensure 16 \\ncomparisons at least.  With the latest 64 bit processors, we could have 8 \\ncomparisons at the most.  Machine code can contribute significantly to such speed \\nups.  \\n \\nMost of the recently available chess engines have procedures developed on the basis \\nof principles sketched in this short review.  It appears to us that it is quite possible to \\nintroduce a more efficient algorithm which would avoid the inflated 512 bit structure, \\nby relying on variant strings of moves coded in the 16 bit format. \\n \\n \\n3.  NEW APPROACH BASED ON VARIANT STRINGS \\n \\nDuring the tree expansion when any regular search algorithm that follows the rule of \\nregular side to move change  is employed (such as AlphaBeta [1],[4],[8] PVS, \\nNegaScout;  null move [5] is excluded here as it permits one side to execute two \\nmoves in a turn) so-called variant strings are generated.  These strings are actually \\nmove lists that start at the root of the search tree and end up in the terminal node being \\nevaluated.  This concept is quite similar to the concept of best-line.  As a matter of \\nfact, best-line is a variant that contains best moves for both sides (own side and the \\nopponent).   Depending on the manner of coding there might be different types of \\nvariant strings.  For instance, the main draw string in Figure 1 can be presented as \\nfollows: \\n \\nQh6+  Kg8  Qg5+  Kh7  Qh5+  Kg7  Qg5+  Kh8  Qh6+  … \\n \\nAlternatively, we could use a similar, but basically equivalent, positional notation \\napplied in many chess programs (most notably the Winboard GUI) (striving to unify \\nand compress information): \\n  \\nC1H6  H8G8  H6G5  G8H7  G5H5  H7G7  H5G5  G7H8  G5H6  … \\n \\nUsing positional notation it is easy to obtain information regarding the from- and to- \\nsquares (starting and destination piece movements).  If we take only a brief glance we \\ncan see that 4 bytes (32 bits) are necessary to code one single move.  However, it is \\npossible to reduce the number of bytes to 16 in coding one move.  Viewing a \\npositional matrix that has 8X8 squares, 6 bits (or 64 combinations) are necessary to \\ncode these squares.  In case of a 12X12 matrix 144 squares or 8 bits are required.   \\n \\nThis means that a 16-bit system of coding can be defined in a way that the from- and \\nto- squares are coded by using 8 bits. \\n \\n \\n \\n6 \\nSuch a simple coding system has served as a basis for an original procedure for draw \\ndetection by help of variant strings.  The basic premise is that the information helping \\ndraw detection is not obtained via positions but by help of variants coded in the \\nprevious section.  In Axon, our chess playing program, the organization of the move-\\ngenerator and the tree search system is embedded in the type of coding we have just \\ndescribed in general.  Variant strings that are formed in the tree search all the way to \\nthe terminal nodes serve as input to the move repetition procedure.  The next section \\nwill describe and analyze the algorithm we used to achieve this goal and thus speed up \\nthe program itself. \\n \\n \\n4. ALGORITHM \\n \\nA great majority of contemporary computer chess searchers has evolved from some \\nsort of recursion.  The basic types of algorithms that have already been mentioned \\nhave also been based on recursive procedures. Axon has a recursive kernel which \\nmakes the recognition of  repetition detection a little more complex as variant strings \\nare formed within the main program stack together with other important parameters \\ncrucial to the searcher (Alpha Beta values, positions, return value addresses, etc.). \\nSince the repetition detection needs access to the variant string starting from the \\nterminal node backwards, this information is not easy to reach through the stack, \\nwhich is commonplace in recursive programs. \\n \\nOn the other hand, it is quite handy to use the same procedure together with the game \\nhistory (a list of the previously played moves) so as to maximise the efficiency of the \\nprocedure.  Having in mind such issues, the authors are willing to suggest the \\nfollowing solution (the string annotation is in the standard programming language \\nPascal):  \\n \\nThe ancillary string is introduced: \\n \\nlist_of_moves : array [0..254] of word; \\n \\n \\nThe string list_of_moves is supposed to memorise the game history as well as the \\ncurrent string generated as a result of the tree calculation.  As a matter of fact, the \\nmentioned string contains 16-bit coded moves starting with the initial move up to the \\nterminal node.  Before the initialisation of the iterative searcher the procedure \\nGenerate_list_of moves is invoked and it resets the whole string reading into it 16-bit \\ncoded moves taken over from the ancillary string containing the game history. Such a \\nstring is being updated during the activity of the searcher so that the procedure \\nenabling the move generator on the basis of the search depth writes the coded moves \\ndirectly into the string marked as list_of_moves.  The address (offset) of the element \\nthat was put down last is written into the variable move_TOS of the word type.  \\nDefined in this manner, the data represent input parameters that generate the \\nprocedure dubbed PERPETUAL whose details will be presented in the next section. \\n \\nThe move coding generated in the procedure move_generator is done on the basis of  \\nan inherently spatial principle.  To speed up the coding, Axon employs a spatial one-\\ndimensional 8-bit address of the from- and to- square.  To illustrate this, let us return \\n \\n7 \\nto the previous section and the first move in the draw line C1H6 (Figure 1).  If we \\ncode the chessboard unidimensionally so that the A8 square has a value of 0, the B8 \\nsquare value 1 and the H1 square value of 63 then the move C1-H6 can be coded as \\n58-23, i.e. instead of two 8-bit numbers it can be replaced by one 16-bit number \\nwhose value is 14871 (58*256+23).  All other moves can be coded in the same way. \\nIf move_generator has generated any irreversible move such as a capture, pawn \\nadvance or castling this can be marked by setting the bit of the greatest possible \\nweight in the 8-bit code of the from- square.  Such an action is possible because we \\nneed only 6 bits (26=64) to code the square itself. \\n \\nThe main procedure PERPETUAL  aims to process the structure marked as \\nlist_of_moves and on the basis of that to return one of the two possible logical values:  \\nthe value of 0 if move repetition has been detected and the value that is different from \\n0 if not.  This procedure hinges on the utilisation of the concatenating list: \\n \\nchain_list : array [0..24] of word; \\n \\nThe algorithm of the PERPETUAL procedure can be described using the following \\nsteps: \\n \\n1) The initial indicator is set to the value move_TOS - the address of the last move \\nwritten in the move list; \\n \\n2) All the elements of the concatenating list (chain_list) are set to 0; \\n \\n3) Scanning the move list starts from the last address (move_TOS) towards the lower \\naddresses.  In case the list yields an element whose bit is of the greatest weight \\nmarked 1 the procedure is abandoned immediately as it is an irreversible move \\nmeaning that position repetition has not been detected. \\n \\n4) If the move was reversible it is included in the concatenating list, observing the \\nfollowing rules:  \\n \\n \\n- \\nIf the concatenating list has a move whose to- square is identical with the from- \\nsquare of the current move then the concatenation is performed by way of the \\ntransformation of the moves in the concatenating list. An example:  if the \\nconcatenating list contains the move A1B1 and the current move is B1E5 then \\ninstead of the existing A1B1 the move A1E5 is listed. This rule can be dubbed the \\nrule of transition as it is equivalent to the corresponding relation in mathematics. \\nIf, after the application of the rule of transition, a complete correspondence \\nbetween the from- and to- square has been noted the move is removed from the \\nconcatenating list (the rule of reflexion).  An example:  if the move A1B1 is in the \\nconcatenating list and the current move is B1A1 the application of transition  \\nshould generate A1A1 so that instead of that the corresponding slot in the \\nconcatenating list is filled up by a zero. The basic logic of the procedure is closing \\nthe variant chains. Only in case that all the chains are closed (in other words all \\nelements of the concatenating list are equal to 0) can move repetition be \\nrecognised.  Let us illustrate this point by going back to Figure 1. Suppose that the \\nfollowing line is possible:  C1H6 H8G8 H6G5 G8H8 G5H6 … Since the scanning \\n \\n8 \\nis done backwards it is easy to see that after the first two steps two potential \\nchains of moves are possible (G5H6 and G8H8), after the third step the first chain \\nis closed (H6G5), while the fourth step marks the closing of the second chain \\n(H8G8), so that a we can proclaim a case of move repetition. Thus if all variant \\nchains in the concatenating list close at any point then we have move repetition. \\nThis procedure is repeated after every move from the move list. If the bottom of \\nthe list or any move that has a bit set to the greatest weight is reached the \\nprocedure is terminated as move repetition has not been detected. The procedure \\nappears quite efficient and encompasses even far more complicated positions that \\nexhibit multivariant chains. The following figure presents a chess study that can \\nbe our testing ground where the efficiency of our move repetition detection \\nmethod can be assessed:  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 2. \\n \\nIt is quite clear that Black has enough potential to free its pieces and to win in just one \\nmove. If White is to move it can draw by simply checking the black king, using the \\nrooks along the e-file.  It is curious to note that the program needs some time and a \\nvery deep calculation to realise that, regardless of the complex routes that the black \\nking can take along the three free verticals, the position should be evaluated as 0.00. \\nSuch positions are very good at showing how advantageous the new principle of move \\nrepetition detection is over the traditional and standard one.  The new principle is \\nbased on the highly efficient 16-bit variant chains that could contain dozens of \\nelements but are still less costly than  a great number of very similar 512-bit positions. \\n \\n \\n5.  IMPLEMENTATION \\n \\n \\nThis section will start with a commented listing of a machine code portion that \\nimplements the algorithm that we discussed in the previous section. The procedure is \\npart of the chess program Axon whose kernel has been completely coded in assembly.  \\nThe procedure is very simple and, as opposed to the approach discussed in section 2, \\nwhere 512-bit data structure comparisons were described, employs only 16-bit \\ncomparisons.  Theoretically and practically viewed, speedups in the used procedure \\nwhen compared with the matrix approach while solving one and the same problem are \\n \\n9 \\nconsiderable, especially in the endgame.  The parameters of the procedure are as \\nfollows:  \\n \\nInput: \\n \\nmanevar_TOS: word;         \\n \\n{offset addresses of the top of the variant stack} \\nlist_of_moves: array of word;  \\n{list of moves} \\n \\nOutput: \\n \\nCX: registar;         \\n{contains value 0 if move repetition has been \\nfound or a value different from 0 if that is not \\nthe case}  \\n \\n \\nprocedure PERPETUAL;assembly; \\nasm \\n \\nmov si,[move_TOS] \\n{A pointer is read into the SI register onto the top of      \\nthe variant stack} \\nmov di,offset chain_list \\n{A pointer is read into the DI register into the \\nconcatenating list} \\n      xor ax,ax \\n{AX=0, AX  register stands for the counter of active \\nelements in the concatenating list} \\n      mov cx,24  \\n \\n{CX=24, dimension of the concatenating list} \\n      rep stosw  \\n \\n{The concatenating list is filled with zeroes} \\n \\n@main: \\n \\n \\n \\n{Beginning of the main loop} \\n \\n      mov dx,[si] \\n \\n \\n{The coded move from the move list is read into \\nDX} \\n      test dh,80h  \\n \\n{If it is a pawn move or an exchange no draw detected} \\n      jnz @no_draw \\n \\n \\n      sub si,2 \\n \\n \\n{Moves back to the preceding stack element} \\n \\n@mainscan: \\n \\n      mov di,offset chain_list \\n{DI is a pointer at the beginning of the concatenating \\nlist} \\n      mov cx,24  \\n \\n{CX  marks the capacity of the list} \\n \\n@ms1:                   \\n \\n{Loop that scans the concatenating list} \\ncmp dl,[di+1] \\n{Is the to- square from DX the from- square of a move \\nin the concatenating list?} \\n      jz @chain  \\n \\n \\n       \\n      add di,2 \\n \\n \\n{Increase of the pointer in the concatenating list} \\n      loop @ms1 \\n \\n \\n{Control of the end of the loop} \\n \\n@mainzero: \\n{In case that a corresponding move has not been found \\nin the concatenating list, the list is scanned} \\n \\n10 \\n      xor bx,bx  \\n \\n{BX=0} \\n      mov di,offset chain_list \\n{DI  is the pointer at the beginning of the concatenating \\nlist} \\n      mov cx,24  \\n \\n{CX  is the capacity of the list} \\n@ms2: \\n      cmp [di],bx        \\n \\n{Search for the free element of the concatenating list} \\n      jz @add_node \\n{If this element is found, a new one is added to the list} \\n      add di,2 \\n \\n \\n{Next element…} \\n      loop @ms2           \\n{The counter of elements} \\n      jmp @no_draw \\n{If there are not any other free elements in the list, the \\nexit is @no_draw} \\n \\n@draw:      \\nxor cx,cx     \\n{Draw is found, output register CX is zero} \\n \\n \\njmp @retq \\n@no_draw:   mov cx,1   \\n{Draw is not found, output register CX = 1} \\n@retq:               RET  \\n{Procedure exit} \\n \\n@add_node:  \\n \\n{Addition of a new element to the concatenating list} \\n \\n      mov [di],dx \\n \\n \\n{New element is being set up…} \\n      inc ax \\n \\n \\n{The counter of active elements is increased by 1}  \\n      jmp @main \\n \\n \\n{Jump to the beginning of the main loop} \\n \\n@chain: \\n \\ncmp dh,[di] \\n{If a closed cycle of moves is an issue, that element is \\nreset in the list – filled by a zero} \\njz @no_chain \\n \\n \\n@re_chain: \\n \\n      mov [di+1],dh \\n \\n{In other cases the list is being concatenated} \\n      jmp @main \\n \\n \\n@no_chain: \\n \\n \\n{If deletion of elements is an issue…} \\n \\n      dec ax \\n \\n \\n{Decrease of the counter of active elements by 1} \\n      jz @draw \\n{If there are no other active elements that means that all \\ncombinatorial chains have been closed and that a case of \\nmove repetition has been detected – Draw} \\n mov word ptr [di],0  \\n \\n jmp @main \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nend; \\n \\nThe procedure we have just described is very efficient in its execution and appears to \\nbe superior to the already existing modalities of move repetition and draw detection \\ndue to the advanced algorithm that was implemented in Axon.  \\n \\n \\n11 \\nIn practical play the significance of this procedure is even greater especially in \\nendgames with rooks or queens and exposed kings where checking sequences can be \\nvery long.  Significant portions of the search tree in which move repetition is \\nprocessed are not considered but are simply replaced by the zero value.  In this \\nmanner the tree search speed is enhanced indirectly. 3 \\n \\n \\n5.  EXPERIMENTAL DATA \\n \\nIn order to illustrate the influence of the described procedure on the execution of the \\nAxon chess program we will use a chess position from the WAC.epd chess suite that \\nis widely spread among computer chess programmers.  It is a rook ending with both \\nkings exposed (Figure 3).  Similar positions appear rather frequently in over-the-board \\ntournament chess. The version of Axon we used was a slightly modified one with a \\nnull move generator implemented as well as some other pruning techniques. On the \\nother hand we turned off the heuristic knowledge of endgames so as to make the \\nresults of the search dependent almost solely on the search algorithm [9].  Endgame \\ntablebases (such as the Nalimov tablebases) were not used. The hardware platform \\nwas a PC running on an AMD Athlon 2200+ processor with 256 Mb RAM. The test \\nwas actually an analysis of the position with the algorithm for move repetition turned \\non and off.  The search depth was iteratively increased from ply 1 to ply 12 in both \\nmodalities (move repetition algorithm turned on and off) and the recorded parameters \\nwere: best key move at a given depth, evaluation, node count, total count of terminal \\nand generated positions in both modalities, as  \\n \\n \\n \\nFigure 3.  White to move. \\n \\n \\nwell as the relative speed of generation and the length of the time spent in search.    \\n \\nThe solution leading to the winning sequence is, naturally, Rh8!, thus making it \\npossible for the white king to make a smooth journey to the solitary white pawn which \\nwill soon be promoted to a queen.  Meantime the black rook can check the exposed \\n                                                 \\n3 See Appendix for an illustrative game that Axon played against a program estimated to be >2650 \\nELO at the sudden death level of game in 10 minutes (Diep-Axon). \\n \\n12 \\nwhite king for quite some time.

This is so because the repeated position is detected at a shallower \\ndepth and such positions are evaluated as 0.00 so that the sub-trees stemming from \\nthem are pruned and not extended any further as is the case in the first part of the \\nexperiment. The second part of the experiment shows that the algorithm is slower \\nby about 10%, the time taken up by the move repetition procedure. The decrease \\nin speed is smaller in the middle game or in positions where there are many non-\\nreversible moves. \\n• The tree being generated in the second part of the experiment is smaller by 18% \\njudging by the number of terminal positions, and by 15% counting the number of \\ngenerated positions.  The analysis performed in the second modality has a shorter \\nduration by 10% than the one in the first modality with the move repetition \\nalgorithm off.  \\n \\nThe conclusion to be drawn from our experiment is that the move repetition detection \\nprocedure that is based on the method utilised by the authors processes fewer \\npositions and creates a smaller number of terminal nodes thus compensating for the \\nloss of general processing speed.  The procedure is beneficial in terms of overall \\nperformance achieving a gain of approximately 10%. In endgames with queens and \\nexposed kings this percentage should prove greater.  The authors hope to have \\npresented credible and convincing experimental data to justify the inclusion of their \\nmove repetition detection algorithm into state-of-the-art computer chess programs.  \\n \\n \\n \\n6.   CONCLUSION \\n \\nThe novelty that the authors have proposed in this paper relates to a new approach to \\nthe problem of move repetition detection that is based on variant strings as opposed to \\nthe matrix-based approach used in the majority of the existing chess playing \\nprograms. The authors have attempted to prove the efficiency of their treatment of the \\nproblem in both the areas of implementation and the speed of execution. The \\nalgorithm proposed by the authors has been discussed in detail, with portions of their \\nchess playing program Axon presented in machine code. Axon was also used in a \\nsmall experiment relating to the discussed issue of move repetition detection by \\nmeans of which the authors contend that the implementation of their procedure leads \\nto considerable gain (10% overall) in the processing of the search tree, especially in \\nendgames. As the program used in the experiment (Axon) does not have the positional \\n(matrix-based) algorithm for move repetition detection, it was not possible for the \\nauthors to directly compare the two methods, but they firmly believe that the segment \\nof analysis presented may convince the reader about its advantages.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n14 \\n \\n \\n7.

      "evaluated.  This concept is quite similar to the concept of best-line.  As a matter of \n",
      "fact, best-line is a variant that contains best moves for both sides (own side and the \n",
      "opponent).   Depending on the manner of coding there might be different types of \n",
      "variant strings.  For instance, the main draw string in Figure 1 can be presented as \n",
      "follows: \n",
      " \n",
      "Qh6+  Kg8  Qg5+  Kh7  Qh5+  Kg7  Qg5+  Kh8  Qh6+  … \n",
      " \n",
      "Alternatively, we could use a similar, but basically equivalent, positional notation \n",
      "applied in many chess programs (most notably the Winboard GUI) (striving to unify \n",
      "and compress information): \n",
      "  \n",

      " \n",
      "Using positional notation it is easy to obtain information regarding the from- and to- \n",
      "squares (starting and destination piece movements).  If we take only a brief glance we \n",
      "can see that 4 bytes (32 bits) are necessary to code one single move.  However, it is \n",
      "possible to reduce the number of bytes to 16 in coding one move.  Viewing a \n",
      "positional matrix that has 8X8 squares, 6 bits (or 64 combinations) are necessary to \n",
      "code these squares.  In case of a 12X12 matrix 144 squares or 8 bits are required.   \n",

      "are formed within the main program stack together with other important parameters \n",
      "crucial to the searcher (Alpha Beta values, positions, return value addresses, etc.). \n",
      "Since the repetition detection needs access to the variant string starting from the \n",
      "terminal node backwards, this information is not easy to reach through the stack, \n",
      "which is commonplace in recursive programs. \n",
      " \n",
      "On the other hand, it is quite handy to use the same procedure together with the game \n",
      "history (a list of the previously played moves) so as to maximise the efficiency of the \n",

      " \n",
      " \n",
      "The string list_of_moves is supposed to memorise the game history as well as the \n",
      "current string generated as a result of the tree calculation.  As a matter of fact, the \n",
      "mentioned string contains 16-bit coded moves starting with the initial move up to the \n",
      "terminal node.  Before the initialisation of the iterative searcher the procedure \n",
      "Generate_list_of moves is invoked and it resets the whole string reading into it 16-bit \n",
      "coded moves taken over from the ancillary string containing the game history. Such a \n",
      "string is being updated during the activity of the searcher so that the procedure \n",
      "enabling the move generator on the basis of the search depth writes the coded moves \n",
      "directly into the string marked as list_of_moves.  The address (offset) of the element \n",
      "that was put down last is written into the variable move_TOS of the word type.  \n",

      "need only 6 bits (26=64) to code the square itself. \n",

      " \n",
      "2) All the elements of the concatenating list (chain_list) are set to 0; \n",
      " \n",
      "3) Scanning the move list starts from the last address (move_TOS) towards the lower \n",
      "addresses.  In case the list yields an element whose bit is of the greatest weight \n",
      "marked 1 the procedure is abandoned immediately as it is an irreversible move \n",
      "meaning that position repetition has not been detected. \n",
      " \n",

      "following rules:  \n",
      " \n",
      " \n",
      "- \n",
      "If the concatenating list has a move whose to- square is identical with the from- \n",
      "square of the current move then the concatenation is performed by way of the \n",
      "transformation of the moves in the concatenating list. An example:  if the \n",
      "concatenating list contains the move A1B1 and the current move is B1E5 then \n",
      "instead of the existing A1B1 the move A1E5 is listed. This rule can be dubbed the \n",
      "rule of transition as it is equivalent to the corresponding relation in mathematics. \n",
      "If, after the application of the rule of transition, a complete correspondence \n",
      "between the from- and to- square has been noted the move is removed from the \n",
      "concatenating list (the rule of reflexion).  An example:  if the move A1B1 is in the \n",
      "concatenating list and the current move is B1A1 the application of transition  \n",
      "should generate A1A1 so that instead of that the corresponding slot in the \n",
      "concatenating list is filled up by a zero. The basic logic of the procedure is closing \n",
      "the variant chains. Only in case that all the chains are closed (in other words all \n",
      "elements of the concatenating list are equal to 0) can move repetition be \n",
      "recognised.  Let us illustrate this point by going back to Figure 1. Suppose that the \n",
      "following line is possible:  C1H6 H8G8 H6G5 G8H8 G5H6 … Since the scanning \n",
      " \n",
      "8 \n",
      "is done backwards it is easy to see that after the first two steps two potential \n",
      "chains of moves are possible (G5H6 and G8H8), after the third step the first chain \n",
      "is closed (H6G5), while the fourth step marks the closing of the second chain \n",
      "(H8G8), so that a we can proclaim a case of move repetition. Thus if all variant \n",
      "chains in the concatenating list close at any point then we have move repetition. \n",

      "However, the increase of search depth the move repetition algorithm is evidently \n",
      "beneficial here. This is so because the repeated position is detected at a shallower \n",
      "depth and such positions are evaluated as 0.00 so that the sub-trees stemming from \n",

      "in speed is smaller in the middle game or in positions where there are many non-\n",

      " \n",
      "The novelty that the authors have proposed in this paper relates to a new approach to \n",
      "the problem of move repetition detection that is based on variant strings as opposed to \n",
      "the matrix-based approach used in the majority of the existing chess playing \n",
      "programs. The authors have attempted to prove the efficiency of their treatment of the \n",
      "problem in both the areas of implementation and the speed of execution. The \n",
      "algorithm proposed by the authors has been discussed in detail, with portions of their \n",
      "chess playing program Axon presented in machine code. Axon was also used in a \n",
      "small experiment relating to the discussed issue of move repetition detection by \n",
      "means of which the authors contend that the implementation of their procedure leads \n",
      "to considerable gain (10% overall) in the processing of the search tree, especially in \n",
      "endgames. As the program used in the experiment (Axon) does not have the positional \n",
      "(matrix-based) algorithm for move repetition detection, it was not possible for the \n",
      "authors to directly compare the two methods, but they firmly believe that the segment \n",
      "of analysis presented may convince the reader about its advantages.  \n",

The authors propose a new method based on variant strings generated by the search algorithm, which they believe is more efficient than the standard approach that utilizes positional matrices. The article includes a detailed description of the algorithm, its implementation in the Axon chess program, and experimental data comparing the program's performance with and without the implemented procedure for draw detection. The results suggest that the new approach leads to a considerable gain in the processing of the search tree, especially in endgames.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'prompt_feedback': {'block_reason': 0, 'safety_ratings': []}, 'finish_reason': 'STOP', 'model_name': 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'safety_ratings': []}, id='run--b4440368-f5c2-42c3-ae05-be6f60866059-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 10109, 'output_tokens': 112, 'total_tokens': 10221, 'input_token_details': {'cache_read': 0}})"
